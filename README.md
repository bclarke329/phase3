# Welcome to DermaLog
<br>
This project is a rebuild of the application I built for my Sinatra project, while completeting Flatiron's Online Software Enginnering Online Course. This application was rebuilt using the Ruby On Rails Framework. 
<br>
In this version of the application, a user can signup using an email and password, or sign up using their Google credentials. Once logged in, a user can create a new routine and keep track of the changes to their skin health. They can also review the application's growing database on skincare products and leave or view reviews by other users. 


# Starting the Application
