# Welcome to DermaLog
<br>
This project is a rebuild of the application I built for my Sinatra project, while completeting Flatiron's Online Software Enginnering Online Course. This application was rebuilt using the Ruby On Rails Framework. 
<br>
In this version of the application, a user can signup using an email and password, or sign up using their Google credentials. Once logged in, a user can create a new routine and keep track of the changes to their skin health. They can also review the application's growing database on skincare products and leave or view reviews by other users. 


# Starting the Application
<p>To view the application, fork and clone this repository
<br>
Run `bundle install` to install gem dependencies. 
<br>
Navigate to  `localhost:3000`, then just create an account to check out the app. 
<br>

# Stretch Goals

- Find an API, or populate the products database with more skincare products, add descriptions, and photos. <br>
-Add CSS. I plan to use this project to practice my CSS skills once I complete the program. <br>
-Allow users to upload images to their logs, to keep track of daily changes. <br>
-Allow users to upload a profile picture. <br>
-Create some sort of profile, so users can follow each other. <br>
-Eventually host this application and switch to a postgres database. <br>

# Contributing 
<br>
Please do not make any contributions to this project. This project was built for the sole purpose of practicing the RoR framework and submitting it as my project for Flatiron's phase 3 project. Thank you.
